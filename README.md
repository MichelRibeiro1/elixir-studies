Hey.

That's my first step to learn a bit more about programming languages and Elixir will be my choice this time. My guide book is the [Learn Functional Programming with Elixir](https://www.amazon.com.br/Functional-Programming-Elixir-Ulisses-Almeida/dp/168050245X).

I'll organize my flow by using one branch for each chapter.
